# FXCore-libraries
Library files for use with the FXCore preprocessor program to generate FXCore source code  

Files:  
fxcdsp.fxl : The example library from the website.  
fxc_filter_curve.fxl : Filters and POT curve programs from AN-7, modified in most cases to use MREGs as inputs and outputs so users can change how things are controlled. POT curve programs also use MREGs as source/destinations so you can raise any positive value to a power not just POT inputs.  
fxc_util.fxl : Some utilities like getting the Nth root of a number, using SIN and COS of a wave to generate a wave at twice the frequency, etc.
