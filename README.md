# FXCore-libraries
Library files for use with the FXCore preprocessor program to generate FXCore source code

Files:
fxcdsp.fxl : The example library from the website.
fxc_filter_curve.fxl : Filters and POT curve programs from AN-7, modified in most cases to use MREGs as inputs and outputs so users can change how things are controlled. POT curve programs also use MREGs as source/destinations so you can raise any positive value to a power not just POT inputs.
